I am a student in my 4th year at Queen's University, currently studying Computer Engineering.

My primary interests lie in low level programming and working with software and hardware, as well as reverse engineering and malware analysis. The main languages I use are Rust, python, and C/C++.

I also do some CTFs, mainly focusing on Reverse Engineering, but also occassionaly branching to other categories like Binary Exploitation or Cryptography.

Here you can find my CTF challenge write ups, projects (not many) and links to contact me.
