I am a student in my 4th year at Queen's University, currently studying Computer Engineering. 

My primary interests lie in low level programming and working with software and hardware. 
I've also been doing some Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation in CTFs, while exploring some cryptography. I'd like to start getting into real malware analysis for Windows and Linux.

Here you can find my write ups for challenges, projects (not many) and links to contact me.
